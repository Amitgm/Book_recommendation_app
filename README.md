# Book_recommendation_app
An app to recommend books

The Book Recommender System is a user-friendly application designed to recommend books based on a user's query emotion and category. Built with Gradio and Python, this tool provides an intuitive interface for users to input their preferences and receive personalized book recommendations instantly. The system is lightweight, easy to use, and does not require complex ML-Ops pipelines, making it ideal for quick deployment and experimentation.

# How It Works

The application uses a pre-trained or custom-trained model to generate book recommendations based on two key inputs:

Emotion: The user's current mood or emotional state (e.g., happy, sad, adventurous).

Category: The genre or category of books the user is interested in (e.g., fiction, non-fiction, mystery).

The system processes these inputs and returns a list of recommended books tailored to the user's preferences.
